I have selected 6 datasets from Gapminder for my Analysis on women education and its impact on economic and human wellbeing.

***Following are the datasets and their description :

'Completition rate total.csv' - Primary completion rate is the percentage of students completing the last year of primary school.

'Completition rate male.csv' - Primary completion rate is the percentage of male students completing the last year of primary school.

'Completition rate female.csv' - Primary completion rate is the percentage of female students completing the last year of primary school.

'indicator life_expectancy_at_birth.csv' - The average number of years a newborn child would live if current mortality patterns were to stay the same.

'indicator_f 15-64 labour to pop percent.csv' - For age group 15-64, percentage of female labor to total female population.

'indicator_gdp_percapita_growth.csv' - GDP per capita growth (annual %)

***Following are the questions I would like to explore with the above datasets:

Question 1: Has Primary School completion rate of women increased through the years and therefore difference between Male and Women Primary school completion rate decreased and does it impact female labour participation rate?

Question 2: How does female labour participation rate impact economic well being or GDP per capita growth ?

Question 3: Does GDP per capita growth play a role in human wellbeing or life expectancy ?
